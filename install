   [2.2]cd /Tools/Database 
   [2.3]mv /Users/CamiloCV/Downloads/instantclient_12_2.zip
   [2.4]unzip instantclient_12_2.zip
Archive: instantclient-basic-macos.x64-11.2.0.4.0.zip
inflating: instantclient_11_2/BASIC_README 
inflating: instantclient_11_2/adrci 
inflating: instantclient_11_2/genezi 
inflating: instantclient_11_2/libclntsh.dylib.11.1 
inflating: instantclient_11_2/libnnz11.dylib 
inflating: instantclient_11_2/libocci.dylib.11.1 
inflating: instantclient_11_2/libociei.dylib 
inflating: instantclient_11_2/libocijdbc11.dylib 
inflating: instantclient_11_2/ojdbc5.jar 
inflating: instantclient_11_2/ojdbc6.jar 
inflating: instantclient_11_2/uidrvci 
inflating: instantclient_11_2/xstreams.jar 
At the end of the process a new directory instantclient_11_2 was created under Tools/Database. This directory will be our ORACLE_HOME directory.

In order to connect to the database the tnsnames.ora file have to be created in the right sub-directory of ORACLE_HOME:
cd instantclient_11_2
mkdir -p network/admin
cd  network/admin
cat tnsnames.ora << 'END'
# tnsnames.ora Network Configuration
# Generated by Oracle configuration tools.
tns_name =
  (DESCRIPTION =
    (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = db_server)(PORT = db_port))
    (CONNECT_DATA =
      (SERVER = DEDICATED)
      (SERVICE_NAME = sid_or_service_name)
    )
  )

END
The tnsnames.ora file is used to store all connection information related to any database used. Here:
tns_name is the name used to reference the oracle connection from sqlplus;
db_server is the database server name (server name, server dns name or ip);
sid_or_server_name is the database sid or its service name.
The last step required  is to set the ORACLE_HOME variable and modify both PATH and DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH system variables.
