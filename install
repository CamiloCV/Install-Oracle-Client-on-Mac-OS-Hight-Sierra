Install Oracle Client on Mac OS Hight Sierra
Yes, it is possible to install Oracle Client on Mac Os Hight Sierra, it may help you to connect the sqldeveloper to a database 

Just follow the steps.

[1] Download the Instant Client
   ##I download the Version 12.2.0.1.0 (64-bit) Updated 15-Jan-2018 are
      Go to the oracle site [ WEB ];
      Accept the agreement;
      Select Instant Client for Mac OS Version 12.2.0.1.0 (64-bit) Updated 15-Jan-2018;

    ##Select Oracle Client distribution "Instant Client Package - Basic: All files required to run OCI, OCCI, and JDBC-OCI applications" from 12.2.0.4.0 version (64-bit);
    
download the package (http://download.oracle.com/otn/mac/instantclient/11204/instantclient-basic-macos.x64-11.2.0.4.0.zip) using your Oracle free account.
Then I installed Oracle Instant Client in /Tools/Database directory with the following commands:
mkdir -p /Tools/Database
cd /Tools/Database 
mv /Users/cadili/Downloads/instantclient-basic-macos.x64-11.2.0.4.0.zip .
unzip instantclient-basic-macos.x64-11.2.0.4.0.zip
Archive: instantclient-basic-macos.x64-11.2.0.4.0.zip
inflating: instantclient_11_2/BASIC_README 
inflating: instantclient_11_2/adrci 
inflating: instantclient_11_2/genezi 
inflating: instantclient_11_2/libclntsh.dylib.11.1 
inflating: instantclient_11_2/libnnz11.dylib 
inflating: instantclient_11_2/libocci.dylib.11.1 
inflating: instantclient_11_2/libociei.dylib 
inflating: instantclient_11_2/libocijdbc11.dylib 
inflating: instantclient_11_2/ojdbc5.jar 
inflating: instantclient_11_2/ojdbc6.jar 
inflating: instantclient_11_2/uidrvci 
inflating: instantclient_11_2/xstreams.jar 
At the end of the process a new directory instantclient_11_2 was created under Tools/Database. This directory will be our ORACLE_HOME directory.

In order to connect to the database the tnsnames.ora file have to be created in the right sub-directory of ORACLE_HOME:
cd instantclient_11_2
mkdir -p network/admin
cd  network/admin
cat tnsnames.ora << 'END'
# tnsnames.ora Network Configuration
# Generated by Oracle configuration tools.
tns_name =
  (DESCRIPTION =
    (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = db_server)(PORT = db_port))
    (CONNECT_DATA =
      (SERVER = DEDICATED)
      (SERVICE_NAME = sid_or_service_name)
    )
  )

END
The tnsnames.ora file is used to store all connection information related to any database used. Here:
tns_name is the name used to reference the oracle connection from sqlplus;
db_server is the database server name (server name, server dns name or ip);
sid_or_server_name is the database sid or its service name.
The last step required  is to set the ORACLE_HOME variable and modify both PATH and DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH system variables.
